== Description ==

OSD Simple Table plugin allows you to quickly create tables within your Wordpress content area using simple tags.  This plugin is very easy to use and extremely light weight. OSD Simple table supports the ability to define your own delimiters for the entire site and on a per table basis. It also supports any custom attribute, colspans, rowspans, table headers, footers, widths, and borders.  If you are tired of the bulky and difficult to use table plugins out there this one is sure to hit the spot.  This was created out of a need for simple light weight error free table generator.  After trying several out there we decided to create our own. It turned out so well that we are sharing it with the community.  The plugin will be updated as needed with wordpress changes and user requests.  Thank you! OSD Web Dev
